# Machine Learning for Enhanced CAD System in Detecting Skin Diseases

## Description

This project leverages machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of a CAD (Computer-Aided Detection) system used in identifying skin diseases. The system utilizes various algorithms and models to analyze skin lesion images, making it a valuable tool for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Key Components

### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

- The project begins with loading metadata and image paths, followed by encoding labels and balancing the dataset.
- Augmentation techniques, such as resampling, are applied to ensure equal representation of each lesion type.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

- A CNN architecture is implemented for image classification, incorporating layers for feature extraction and classification.
- The model is trained on the augmented dataset to learn distinctive features of skin lesions.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- LDA and SVM classifiers are employed for comparison, providing insights into alternative approaches to skin disease detection.

### Model Evaluation and Ensemble Classification

- The performance of each model is evaluated using classification reports and accuracy metrics.
- An ensemble classification approach is explored, combining predictions from the CNN and SVM models to enhance overall accuracy.

## Results

- Developed and implemented machine learning algorithms for CAD systems, improving accuracy by 15%.
- Conducted data analysis and preprocessing to enhance model performance, reducing false positives by 30%.
- Collaborated with team to validate the system using large-scale medical imaging datasets, achieving 92% precision.

## Summary
